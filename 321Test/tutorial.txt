Energy is a Primary resource used to perform tasks such as going to lectures or studying. 
It is displayed as a Red bar on the bottom left of your screen. You always begin the day with full energy which is slowly depleted as you perform activities during the day.
You can gain more energy by increasing your Stamina (STA) which will allow you to do more activities in a day.
But be careful if you run out of energy you will Pass Out and not be able to do anything else for the day.
#
Academic Power is a Primary resource used to learn course content and complete assignments and laboratories. It is displayed as a Blue bar just below your energy meter.
You can gain more Academic Power by increasing your Intelligence(INT) which will allow you to complete learning activities quicker.
Once you run out of learning power in a day you must wait for it to recharge the next time you sleep.

Stress is an indicator of the Pressure you feel as a University Student and is increased by undertaking activities. It is displayed as a Yellow bar just below your energy meter.
You can Reduce the rate of gaining Stress by increasing your Social(SOC) which will allow you to complete stress reducing and Stat Enhancing activities.
Once you Max out on Stress in a day you all tasks you do will be much less effective.
